# Version Control Log -- Eichberg Construction Payroll System

## v6.0 Final
All the code and milestone documents are in the right folders. The src/ folder has the
Python files that Connor created: test.py. The docs/ folder has all the milestone docs
that the team has created.

## v5.0 Cleanup
Kylah had to cleanup the Github. Some teammates had uploaded documents in the wrong spots,
so I moved them to the docs/ and deleted any duplicate folders and documents.

## v4.0 Simplify Structure
Currently, we only have the main branch to keep things simple. Version control is clean right
now, but we must still add feature branches to make it more simplified and organized.

## v3.0 Documentation
Everybody uploaded their documentation. Created the /docs folder and added all the milestone 
documents.

## v2.0 Setup
At the beginning, there was no protection for the Github. Now, moving forward, no one will be 
able to change anything without approval. It is required for pull requests and review before
any merges.

## v1.0 GitHub
Created the Github repository for the Eichberg Construction Payroll System. Added the README
and set up folders to start the project.
